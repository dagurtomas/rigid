# rigid

A Lean/mathlib formalization project for rigid analytic geometry, including Tate and affinoid
algebras, rigid spaces, Berkovich spaces, and their comparison.

The standalone mathlib-only specification is [`Rigid/Challenge.lean`](Rigid/Challenge.lean). The
implementation-facing comparator copy is [`Rigid/Development.lean`](Rigid/Development.lean). Both
contain the same declarations in namespace `RigidChallenge`; Development imports project modules and
replaces sorried bodies as implementations become available. See [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the
dependency order, scope decisions, and open questions around the precise comparison theorem.
